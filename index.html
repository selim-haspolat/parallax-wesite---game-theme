        <h2 class="second-h2">Gameplay</h2>
        <p class="pr">Like its predecessors, Team Fortress 2 is centered around two opposing teams competing for an objective. These two teams are meant to represent a demolition and a construction company as a part of the backstory: Reliable Excavation Demolition (<span class="red">RED</span>)  and Builders League United (<span class="blu">BLU</span>) . Players can choose to play as one of nine classes in these teams, each with their unique strengths, weaknesses, abilities, and roles. Although the abilities of some classes have changed from earlier Team Fortress incarnations, the essential elements of each class have remained</p>

        <h2 class="third-h2">Maps</h2>
        <p class="pr">On the PC and OS X versions of Team Fortress 2, the initial release only included six official Valve maps, with several dozen more being added to the game over the years by Valve and the Team Fortress 2 community. On the console versions, however, these original six maps, all released by Valve, are still the only maps available. The official maps are commonly themed with an evil genius or retro-spy tech mentality, with secret bases that are concealed within industrial warehouses, as well as exaggerated super weapons such as laser cannons and missile launch facilities taking the role of objectives.</p>

        <h2 class="fourth-h2">Why Team Fortress 2</h2>
        <p class="pr"><span class="kisaltma" title="Team Fortress 2">TF2</span>  is THE iconic classbased shooter. The game offers perfect controls and a perfect balance between the classes and a unique cartoonish style that, like Cell Shaders in general, does not run out of time. <br>Also <span class="kisaltma" title="Team Fortress 2">TF2</span>  has one of the most stable servers I have ever played on, I can not recall a single fallout or delay because of their servers - which made me ragequit about three games in the last decade. <br>And let us not forget the hats.</p>
